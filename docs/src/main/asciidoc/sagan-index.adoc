This project provides https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign[OpenFeign] integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms.

## Features

* Declarative REST Client: Feign creates a dynamic implementation of an interface decorated with JAX-RS or Spring MVC annotations

## Getting Started


```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableFeignClients
public class WebApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(WebApplication.class, args);
	}

	@FeignClient("name")
	static interface NameService {
		@RequestMapping("/")
		public String getName();
	}
}

```
